#+title: Use Nostr from Emacs

- replaced nostr library with pynostr
- fork from original nostr-emacs

** Setup
- nostr_keys.py provides a way to generate the secp256k1 keys necessary to make posts, I don't know of any emacs packages that do this.
- Setup a venv and `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Set the required variables in `nostr.el`, and generate a private key (can be done from the python tool)
- Load `nostr.el` into your emacs

** Roadmap
- Integrate with elfeed or GNUs for feed and commenting
- Save and load keys with password protection
